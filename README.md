# Revisiting the Effect Size Analog for Nonlinear Regression: A Simpler Approach for Interpretability (GOALS)

When calculating the influence a varaible has on a model, there is a tension between accounting for all linear and nonlinear effects, interpretability and transparency of the algorithm, and computatational complexity and feasibility.

## R Packages for GOALS

The GOALS software requires the installation of the following R libraries:

[BAKR](https://github.com/lorinanthony/BAKR) (via GitHub)

[corpcor](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/corpcor/index.html)

[doParallel](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doParallel/index.html)

[MASS](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/index.html)

[Matrix](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Matrix/index.html)

[Rcpp](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/index.html)

[RcppArmadillo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppArmadillo/index.html)

[RcppParallel](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RcppParallel/index.html)

Unless stated otherwise, the easiest method to install many of these packages is with the following example command entered in an R shell:

    install.packages("corpcor", dependecies = TRUE)

Alternatively, one can also [install R packages from the command line](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-admin.html#Installing-packages).
